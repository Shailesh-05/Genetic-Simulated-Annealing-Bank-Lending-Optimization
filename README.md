# Genetic-Simulated-Annealing-Bank-Lending-Optimization
Built a hybrid model of Genetic and Simulated-Annealing Algorithms to optimize bank objectives on the loan portfolio.
->Brainstormed on maximizing bank profit & minimizing probability of bank default in search for dynamic lending decision.
->Obtained fitness function value and an array of binary digits (1-Customer selected and 0-not selected) as the final solution.
->Achieved a best optimal fitness value of 3.1854 with hybrid of genetic and simulated annealing algorithm compared to Genetic Algorithmâ€™s 2.723.
